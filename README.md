Hi, 

I'm Amy Washburn Butler, owner of Seven Thunder Software.

Web development projects include <a href="https://7Thunders.biz" title="Web Development: Educational Games">simple online games</a> and example projects with 
<a href="https://python.7Thunders.biz" title="Python Development">Python</a>, 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/ph/topics-php.php" title="PHP &amp; MySQL">PHP, MySQL</a>, 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/h5/topics.php" title="HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript">HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</a>, 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/3d/models.php" title="3D Web Interactive">WebGL, GLSL (C language)</a>  and 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/ph/post.php" title="RESTful Post:Overview">RESTful Web services</a>. Some of the code will post here on GitHub.

Two apps on the Microsoft store, <q>Paintball Politics</q> and <q>3D Translator</q> were prepared with C#, Visual Studio 2019 or Unreal Engine. 

Many projects incorporate graphics with Photoshop or 3ds Max, some Adobe Illustrator or After Effects. See <a href="https://art.7Thunders.biz" title="Illustration">Illustration</a>.

The current plan involves porting WebGL apps to <a href="https://vr.7thunders.biz/android/3d.php" title="Free Android Apps">Android Java, the NDK and OpenGL ES</a>. Hopefully, at some point in time, these apps will port to Google Cardboard..

See examples and tutorials through https://7Thunders.biz. Reach me at SevenThundersMobile@gmail.com.

Thank you,
-Amy
