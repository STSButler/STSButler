Hi from Amy Washburn Butler, 
<p>
Versatile and helpful with a background in both software development and illustration, including digital tools from back end, middleware and front end, to graphics applications.
</p>
<p>
Web development projects include <a href="https://7Thunders.biz" title="Web Development: Educational Games">simple online games, tutorials</a>, and example projects with 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/js/javascript.php" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>,
<a href="https://python.7Thunders.biz" title="Python Development">Python</a>, 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/ph/topics-php.php" title="PHP &amp; MySQL">PHP, MySQL</a>, 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/h5/topics.php" title="HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript">HTML5, CSS3</a>, 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/3d/models.php" title="3D Web Interactive">WebGL, GLSL (C language)</a>  and 
<a href="https://code.7thunders.biz/ph/post.php" title="RESTful Post:Overview">RESTful Web services</a>. 
I'm slowly posting code from current online Web projects to GitHub. 
</p>

<h2>3D Programming</h2>
<p>
Recent focus includes efficient 3D development, combining both 3D graphics with 3D programming in WebGL. 
My goal is to port from WebGL to Android and OpenGL ES, then to Google Cardboard.
I ported one WebGL project to an
<a href="https://vr.7thunders.biz/android/3d.php" title="Free Android Apps">Android app</a>, then posted the code here on GitHub. 
</p>

<h2>Illustration</h2>
<p>
Many projects incorporate graphics with Photoshop or 3ds Max, some Adobe Illustrator or After Effects. See <a href="https://art.7Thunders.biz" title="Illustration">Illustration</a> examples online.
</p>

<h2>Windows Development: Unreal Engine</h2>
<p> 
Two apps were prepared with C#, Visual Studio 2019 or Unreal Engine. Apps <q>Paintball Politics</q> and <q>3D Translator</q>, are free on the Microsoft Store. If you'd like to see the code and blueprints, let me know. Email: SevenThundersMobile@gmail.com.

Thank you,<br/>
