Hi, I'm Amy Washburn Butler, owner of Seven Thunder Software.

I work with Python, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML5, WebGL, GLSL (C language), CSS3, RESTful Web services, Visual Studio, OOP, C#, some WordPress, Unreal Engine and XML. 

I'm capable with Photoshop and 3ds Max, with some Adobe Illustrator, Sound Booth and After Effects.

I have preliminary skills with Android Java, the NDK and OpenGL ES. I'm interested in virtual reality, starting with Google Cardboard.

See examples and tutorials through https://7Thunders.biz. Reach me at SevenThundersMobile@gmail.com.

Thank you,
-Amy
